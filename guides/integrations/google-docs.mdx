# Streamlining Workflows with Google Docs and Hansei AI Integration

Streamlining workflows and integrating technologies are key to boosting productivity and efficiency in the modern workplace. Using Zapier, we can seamlessly connect Google Docs with Hansei AI to automatically transfer information between the two platforms. In this document, we'll walk through the simple steps to configure this integration so that new Google Docs become instantly available as knowledge in Hansei.

## Steps to Connect Google Docs with Hansei

### Step 4: Trigger in Zapier

In Zapier, a trigger represents an event that initiates an automated workflow or zaps. For example, uploading a file to Google Drive could be a trigger. When that event occurs, it triggers the next step in the workflow which is the action.

### Step 5: Select Google Drive as Trigger

1. Search for any trigger, in our case Google Drive, and select it.
2. Connect Google Drive with your Google account.
3. Choose a trigger event (e.g., "New File").
4. Complete all the necessary steps to connect with Google Drive.
5. Test the trigger to ensure the connection is successful.

### Step 9: Define Action in Zapier

The action is what happens after the trigger event takes place. For the Google Drive example, the action might be to send a default notification message confirming the file was uploaded successfully.

1. Search for Hansei and select it as the action.
2. Choose an event from various options provided (e.g., "Add File to Knowledge Base").
3. Set up the action by filling in the required fields (e.g., "Select Collection," "Filename," and "File").
4. Test the connection by clicking on "Test Step."

### Step 11: Hansei Integration

1. Log in to Hansei and click on View API Keys.
2. Create a new API Key and give it any name of your preference.
3. Copy the generated API Key for further use.

### Step 15: Paste API Key in Zapier

Paste the API key generated in Step 11 into the corresponding field in Zapier to complete the integration. Your Google Docs account is now seamlessly integrated with Hansei AI.
