Know more about what Zapier is [here](https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496181725453-Learn-key-concepts-in-Zapier#01H8C8M007K6JTQYNV97BV3ED3)

Step 3: In Zapier, a trigger represents an event that initiates an automated workflow or zaps. For example, uploading a file to Google Drive could be a trigger. When that event occurs, it triggers the next step in the workflow which is the action.

Step 4: Search for any trigger, in our case Google Drive, and select it 

Step 5: Google Drive Trigger will be activated and now connect with the Google account

Step 6: Choose an Event to trigger from “New File”, “New File in Folder”, “NewFolder”, or “Updated File”. In this case, we choose the trigger “New file”.

Step 7: Complete all the steps to trigger and connect with Google Drive

Step 8: After Completing all the steps to complete the Trigger, Click on Test the Trigger. Your Google Drive account Connection will be Tested

Step 9: The action is what happens after the trigger event takes place. For the Google Drive example, the action might be to send a default notification message confirming the file was uploaded successfully.

Search for Hansei and select it as Action

Step 10: Choose an event and connect among various events provided like 'Add File to Knowledge Base', 'Add Text Content to Knowledge Base', 'Add Webpage Content to Knowledge Base' and, 'Generate Answer'. In this case, we selected the Event 'Add File to Knowledge Base' with Hansei 

Step 11: After Setting up the Action & Event, Test the trigger by filling in the fields 'Select Collection', 'Filename' & 'File'

Step 12: Test the connection by clicking on 'Test Step'
