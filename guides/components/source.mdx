Sources are the elemental building blocks within Hansei, encompassing a spectrum of information including documents, plain text, URLs, sitemaps, and YouTube videos. These diverse data elements empower Hansei to wield its analytical prowess, generating insights, reports, and summaries that elevate workflow efficiency

When you import a source, we calculate the number of pages that are imported. A page is defined as a chunk of data that's approximately equal to 500 words. For example, if you import a long document, it'll be divided into several pages. Please be aware that the quota for source pages only resets at the end of the billing cycle.

## Step 1:
